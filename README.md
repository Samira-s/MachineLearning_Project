# MachineLearning_Project
Welcome to my final project for the Machine Learning Course repository!ðŸ¥°
## Project Description
In this project, we used this ECG dataset:
https://physionet.org/content/ptbdb/1.0.0/

After preprocessing the data in several steps, we trained it by a data generator using different models:
* ANN
* CNN
* LeNet
* ResNet
* VGG

Then compared the results of accuray and loss on train, validation, and test datasets.
At the end, a Cross Validation algorithm accomplished, too.
